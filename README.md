# HexLab

HexLab adds a Hex Editor to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook 7
(as an [extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_tutorial.html****)).
Development is in-progress.

![Hex Editor Extension](https://github.com/ericsnekbytes/hexlab/assets/104786633/0a861480-201f-4c9f-b60b-9684dfcd80f6)

## Usage

Currently, you can use the [command palette](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/commands.html#command-palette) and search for "hex", then click "Hex Editor".

## Installation

Since the extension isn't released yet, you can build and run it
as you would any in-development JupyterLab extension as noted in
the [extension tutorial](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extension/extension_tutorial.html#extension-tutorial).
