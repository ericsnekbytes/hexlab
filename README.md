# HexLab

HexLab adds a Hex Editor to JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook 7
(as an [extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extension/extension_tutorial.html****)).
Development is in-progress.

## TODO

- [X] View local files

- [ ] View files larger than system memory
- [ ] View remote files
- [ ] Integrate with the MIME editor APIs

## Installation

Since the extension isn't released yet, you can build and run it
as you would any in-development JupyterLab extension as noted in
the extension tutorial.
